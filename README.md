## Hi, I’m Shivam 👋

I’m a college student studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with a strong interest in software engineering fundamentals ,backend system design and applied AI & Machine Learning.

I enjoy building small systems to understand how they work internally. I focus on correctness, clarity, and learning through iteration rather than feature count or polish.

---

### 🌱 What I’m currently building and learning

- Backend system design with explicit state and invariants  
- Modeling workflows using relational data and foreign keys  
- Building APIs with Node.js and Express  
- Understanding how data modeling choices affect correctness over time  
- Learning AI and ML fundamentals alongside core software engineering concepts  

Most of my projects are learning focused and intentionally documented to show design decisions, mistakes, and corrections.

### 🧠 Featured work

- **Code Review System**  
  A system design focused project exploring how code review workflows preserve context over time using immutable revisions, explicit state transitions, and revision scoped feedback.


- **Multimodal Audit Engine**
  A system that automatically analyzes YouTube videos against company compliance guidelines. You provide a YouTube link, and the system downloads the video, extracts everything said and written on screen, analyzes it against your compliance rules, and produces a detailed report indicating whether the video complies or lists specific violations.

Pinned repositories reflect what I’m actively exploring, not finished products.

### 🛠️ Technical skills (working knowledge)

- **Languages:** JavaScript,Python, C and C++, SQL  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, REST APIs  
- **Databases:** SQLite, MySQL, relational data modeling  
- **Frontend:** React with Vite, basic UI integration  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Docker for environment specification, Linux basics  

I prefer understanding fundamentals deeply before moving to abstractions.

### 🎬 Creative work

Alongside engineering, I also work as a freelance video editor.  
I enjoy storytelling, pacing, and visual clarity, which strongly influences how I think about software structure and user experience.

### 🌍 Open source and community

I participate in open source communities and learning driven programs.

- **Hacktoberfest participant**  
  Contributed to open source repositories during Hacktoberfest and learned collaborative development through issues, pull requests, and reviews.

### 📖 How I approach learning

I learn best by:
- building end to end systems  
- validating assumptions through implementation  
- documenting mistakes instead of hiding them  
- refining mental models through iteration  

I value growth, feedback, and honest self assessment.
